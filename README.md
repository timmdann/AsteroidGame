# AsteroidGame

## Description

This is a game where you control a spaceship defending the planet from asteroids and hostile forces. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to maneuver the spaceship: up and down for movement, left and right for direction change. Shoot down asteroids, dodge their attacks, and earn points for each destroyed asteroid.

## Usage

Once the game is running, control the spaceship using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Shoot down asteroids, avoid collisions with them, and earn the maximum number of points. The game ends when your spaceship is destroyed.
